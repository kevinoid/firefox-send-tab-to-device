This is the addon-sendtab add-on.  It contains:

* A program (lib/main.js).
* A few tests.
* Some meager documentation.

## Now Obsolete

This addon has been superseded by the [Synced
Tabs](https://wiki.mozilla.org/QA/Synced_Tabs) feature of Firefox Sync (since
[bug 677372](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=677372) was fixed in
Firefox 50).  A tab can be sent to a device by enabling "Open Tabs" in the
"Sync Across All Devices" section of the "Sync" preferences, then
right-clicking on the tab to send and choosing the "Send Tab to Device"
option.
